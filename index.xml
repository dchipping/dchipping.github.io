      <description>Augmented reality in action &amp;ndash; a fast, portable and realistic physics engine is needed to calculate the collisions with complex surfaces in the real world (Lightship SDK)
  Curiosity has recently led me down the road of extended reality (XR), a catch-all term encompassing: Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR) and Virtual Reality (VR). Development of XR experiences interestingly uses much of the same tooling used to create video games, often using game engines like Unity to build and leverage technology in order to create virtual environments.</description>

      <description>An &amp;lsquo;artistic&amp;rsquo; rendition of engine cycles
  As I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading more about software design patterns, I recalled a bit of reading I did during university on rocket engines cycles and how the topic could be thought of in similar terms to a design pattern. The concept of a program&amp;rsquo;s pattern referring to a well recognised way of solving a particular problem. Businesses typically like to implement them in their software designs due to the benefits:</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel, nice to meet ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal site, sporadically updated with a bits of writing on this and that. Writing is the best method I&amp;rsquo;ve found for promoting a deep understanding of a topic, [insert Feynman quote].
Domain-wise, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring the intersection of:
 Highly embodied hardware systems (systems that are highly aware of, and can finely interact with their surroundings/environment), Systems that use on-board computing, networking and software,  &amp;hellip;which can be combined to facilitate more intelligent and autonomous behaviour in real-world systems, and a big space nerd ðŸš€</description>

      <description>LAHM Track (2022): Multi-object tracking algorithms (computer vision task) often maintain and update a &amp;lsquo;visual appearance history&amp;rsquo; encoding for each object being tracked, e.g. the colour of shirt someone is wearing. I used reinforcement learning to optimise this &amp;lsquo;maintain and update&amp;rsquo; process.
  Blockism (2022): Alongside coursemates, created a social virtual reality building game where players work together to build structures and score points before time runs out.</description>
